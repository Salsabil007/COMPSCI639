    "In this lecture, we lay out the foundations of statistical inference via hypothesis testing. Hypothesis tests are used to compare two alternatives. For example, hypothesis tests are used in medicine to determine whether a treatment is effective and in genetics to determine whether a certain specific gene is related to a certain, specific trait, or if a specific gene is related to a specific hereditary disease. A lot of scientific discovery comes from hypothesis testing (and reaches media outlets with often exaggerated findings; just search for \"power posing\" and all the controversy that surrounds it). But not all scientific discovery is accurate. The \"wrong\" discoveries sometimes happen by chance, and sometimes by manipulating statistical tests. This is one of the reasons why it is so important to understand how different types of hypothesis testing procedures work.  "

    "Statistical decision theory provides a framework for making decisions under uncertainty. It encompases both Bayesian and frequentist school of thought (explained later in this section). The basic setup is as follows: we assume that there is some underlying distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ that generated pairs of the data $X$ (think of $X$ as multiple data points) and parameter $\\theta$, where $\\theta$ represents some ground truth (in the case of our binary classification example from last lecture, $\\theta$ represented the label $y$ of a data point). \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{example}\n",
    "Some examples of data $X$ and parameter $\\theta$ are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $X = $ cholesterol level of a patient, $\\theta = $ whether or not the patient had a heart attack;\n",
    "\n",
    "- $X = $ monthly rent and $\\theta = $ a neighborhood of Madison (e.g., downtown, Willy St/Williamson-Marquette, Dudgeon/Monroe, Shorewood Hills, etc.);\n",
    "\n",
    "- $X = $ thickness of ice on lake Mendota and $\\theta = $ one of the months in a calendar year. \n",
    "\\end{example}\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of this setup is that the data $X$ we collected comes from a distribution that is fully specified by $\\theta$ (here $\\theta$ can also be a set of parameters; for example, if the underlying distribution were Bernoulli, $\\theta$ would be its probability of getting a 1, if the underlying distribution were Gaussian, $\\theta$ would be the mean and the standard deviation, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "A decision procedure is a function $f$ that takes data $X$ as the input and outputs a decision, typically to make inferences about $\\theta.$ To determine whether the decision we made was good or bad, we also define a loss function $\\ell(f(X), \\theta)$ that takes a zero value if we made a correct inference about $\\theta$ and some positive value otherwise. For example, in our last lecture, we were talking about constructing a model for binary classification, where the loss function was given by $\\ell(f(X), \\theta) = \\mathbb{1}(f(X) \\neq \\theta)$ and $\\theta = y$ represented the label of a data point $X$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Where frequentist and Bayesian school of thought differ is in how they treat (the lack of knowledge about) the parameter $\\theta$. Both schools of thought assume that $\\theta$ is unknown and want to make inferences about it. In the frequentist school of thought, $\\theta$ is *deterministic* ground truth. Even if there were some random event that generated $\\theta$, for frequentists, $\\theta$ represents what happens *on average* if that event was repeated infinitely many times. By contrast, Bayesians treat $\\theta$ as a random variable. In Bayesian school of thought, $\\theta$ is generated from some probability distribution, and, moreover, we know exactly what that distribution (called prior) is. \n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative way of describing frequentist vs Bayesian perspective is by looking at Bayes Theorem. Both frequentists and Bayesians agree that we can write (by Bayes Theorem):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\mathbb{P}[\\theta|X] = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}[X|\\theta]\\mathbb{P}[\\theta]}{\\mathbb{P}[X]}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Both assume that you get the data $X$, given $\\theta$, i.e., that the data is generated according to probabilities $\\mathbb{P}[X|\\theta].$ Where they depart is in frequentists making decisions *without* the knowledge of $\\mathbb{P}[\\theta]$, whereas Bayesians make decisions taking into account the prior $\\mathbb{P}[\\theta]$. Frequentists will normally work with $\\mathbb{P}[X|\\theta],$ i.e., with the distribution from which the data was generated given the parameter $\\theta,$ while Bayesians, since they assume the knowledge of the prior $\\mathbb{P}[\\theta],$ work with the posterior probabilities $\\mathbb{P}[\\theta|X].$   \n",
    "\n",
    "Both frequentist and Bayesian approaches are useful, but in different settings. Frequentist approaches are generally more robust and are used when there is limited information about the random process that generated the data, or if the decision procedure we are developing is supposed to be used many times, on many different data sets. These approaches are common among computer scientists (and most of what we cover will be from a frequentist perspective). Bayesian point of view is useful when inferences are made by a domain expert who has knowledge or strong beliefs about the random process that generated the data. This perspective is commonly used in areas such as biology, physics, astronomy, etc. "

    "In the simplest (and standard) hypothesis testing setting we have two possible hypotheses: the baseline, that we call \"null\" (or 0) and the alternative \"non-null\" (or 1). Scientific discovery happens when we can credibly and correctly reject the null hypothesis, and decide in favor of the alternative. We always assume that there is some ground truth: the reality that we cannot control. All we are trying to do is distinguish between these two possibilities. Of course, mistakes are unavoidable in this process, as we never have the power of perfectly observing the ground truth: all we get are examples that speak in favor or against the null hypothesis. \n",

    "(Linear) binary classifiers that we saw in the last lecture are used to classify unlabeled points by assigning them labels \"1\" and \"-1\" or \"1\" and \"0\" or \"+\" and \"-\" (all these are equivalent; we get to decide what the labels mean). Another way of looking at binary classifiers is as decision makers: we decide whether to accept the null hypothesis (\"0\" or \"-1\" or \"-\") or the alternative, non-null hypothesis (\"1\" or \"+\"). It is rarely the case that the data can be classified perfectly into positive and negative examples.

One standard approach in hypothesis testing is the classical Neyman-Pearson test (if you saw hypothesis testing in any other classes, you were likely using the Neyman-Pearson test).

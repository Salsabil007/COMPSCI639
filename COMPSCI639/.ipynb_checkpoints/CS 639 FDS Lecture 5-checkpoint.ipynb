    "In this lecture, we learn about more specific tools for hypothesis testing; namely, the null hypothesis significance test and the p-values. We start with a working definition of a statistic (which is necessary for properly setting up a hypothesis test) and then outline the framework of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). The purpose of NHST is to answer the question of when we should be surprised by what we see in the data. Informally, if the data is surprising, this type of test gives us the power to reject the null hypothesis and claim a discovery."

    "A statistic is anything that you can compute based on the data samples that you see. This is a somewhat imprecise definition, but it is sufficient for what we need in this class. A slightly more precise definition would say that a statistic is a rule based on which we compute something from the data, and that \"something\" is the value of the statistic. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we compute only a single number from the data, this is known as the point statistic. For example, empirical mean is a point statistic. There are also interval statistics and set statistics (that we get when we compute a whole interval or a set of values from the data), but point statistics suffice for our purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{example}\n",
    "To get more acquianted with point statistics, we now provide a few examples of what a point statistic is (and is not). Suppose that we are given data samples $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n.$ Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The empirical mean $\\bar{\\mu} = \\frac{X_1 + \\dots X_n}{n}$ is a point statistic.\n",

    "\\end{example}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a statistic itself is a _random variable_, as it is computed from _random data_. The distribution of a statistic is referred to as its sampling distribution. If a point statistic is used to estimate a parameter of an unknown distribution, then it is also referred to as a point estimate. For example, if $X_1, \\dots, X_n$ are samples drawn i.i.d. from the same distribution, then the empirical mean $\\bar{\\mu} = \\frac{X_1 + \\dots X_n}{n}$ is a point estimate of the true mean $\\mathbb{E}[X_i].$ "

    "We now outline the basics of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), which is used in the frequentist setting. The basics are: there are two hypotheses that we want to compare, the null and the alternative (non-null). We assume that the null is true and look at the data. If the data looks too suprising (meaning, too extreme) for the null hypothesis to be true, we reject it in favor of the alternative. Otherwise, we do not reject it. Recall once again that here we will always assume that the null and the alternative are complementary to each other. If we do not make such an assumption, we cannot accept the alternative once we reject the null.\n",

    "* $H_0:$ the null hypothesis. This is the baseline, where nothing interesting is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $H_1:$ the alternative (non-null) hypothesis. We assume that $H_1$ is complementary to $H_0.$ $H_1$ is where interesting stuff happens, like scientific discovery. If we reject $H_0,$ we accept $H_1$ as the best explanation of the data we see.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $S:$ the test statistic. Recall that $S$ is a _random variable,_ as it is computed based on the data, which is randomly generated according to the ground truth (either $H_0$ or $H_1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Null distribution: the probability distribution of $S$ assuming the null hypothesis $H_0$ is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rejection region: the set or region of possible values of $S$ such that if $S$ falls into that region, we reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_1$ (i.e., we accept $H_1$).\n",

If the number of heads falls in the non-rejection region, we _do not_ say that we \"accept\" the null hypothesis. All that we can say is that the data does not support rejecting the null hypothesis.

In particular, in the Neyman-Pearson paradigm, we specify the significance level $\\alpha$ in advance and choose the rejection region as the tails of the null distribution with total mass (probability) equal to $\\alpha.$ This is possible if we know the distribution of the null hypothesis. In our coin tossing example, the rejection region corresponding to $\\alpha = 0.05$ would be $\\{0, 1, 9, 10\\},$ while the rejection region corresponding to $\\alpha = 0.01$ would be $\\{0, 10\\}.$\n",

Our test statistic is the number of heads we see in 10 coin tosses, and in this case we have $S = 9.$ As we stated above, the p-value is the probability that, under the null hypothesis (i.e., assuming $S$ is distributed according to the binomial distribution with parameters $N = 10$ and $q = 0.5$), $S$ takes values at least as extreme as we observed in the experiment. \"At least as extreme\" here means at least as far away from what we expect, that is, at least as far away from the mean.

    "We look back at the table we drew before, and calculate this probability as $p = 0.022.$ This value is _lower_ than the significance level $\\alpha = 0.05,$ so we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative (the coin is unfair!). If we had chosen a lower significance level $\\alpha$, for example, $\\alpha = 0.01,$ then we would not have been able to reject the null hypothesis. This does not mean that we would conclude that the coin is fair! All that we would be able to say is that the data does not support rejecting the null hypothesis.\n",

    "When we assume that we know the null distribution, it is generally possible to compute the p-value. However, as you would expect, we often do not know the distribution of the data. In those cases, if applicable, we can use the concentration inequalities we learned in previous lectures to bound above the p-value. And the procedure is the same as before: if the bound on the p-value is lower than the significance level $\\alpha,$ this is sufficient for rejecting the null hypothesis. However, as we are only estimating the p-value in this case, it is possible that we do not reject the null hypothesis even though the true p-value could actually be below the significance level. "

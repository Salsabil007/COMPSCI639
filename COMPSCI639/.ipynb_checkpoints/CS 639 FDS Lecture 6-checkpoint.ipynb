    "\n",
    "In statistics, p-values are frequently used by making assumptions about the null distribution. In the case of a coin flip, where we count the number of heads as our test statistic and the null hypothesis is that the coin is fair, it is not hard to argue that the null distribution is binomial, as we did in the previous lecture. Let us look at another example similar to coin flipping, but that corresponds to a real-life situation. In this example, we will consider one-sided test: this means that the extreme values become more extreme only in one direction. \n",

    "Amendment VI of the US Constitution states that every individual has the right to a speedy and public trial, by an _impartial_ jury. One requirement for the jury to be impartial is that the potential jurors are selected from a jury panel that is representative of the population where the crime was committed and the trial takes place. While the final jury is selected by deliberate inclusion and exclusion from the jury panel and can have any distribution, the jury panel is supposed to be representative of the local population. The implications of not having a representative jury panel is that the jury might not be impartial, implying that the defendant did not receive access to a fair due process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This issue actually occured in the 1960s, in the case of Robert Swain who was a Black man convicted in Talladega County, Alabama, in 1962. At the time, only men who were at least 21 years old were eligible to serve on a jury. In Talladega County in 1962, within this population of 21+ year old men, 26% were Black. The jury panel in the Robert Swain's trial consisted of 100 men, only 8 of whom were Black. \n",
    "\n",
    "Robert Swain appealed on the grounds of the jury panel not being representative of the population, further citing evidence that all of the jury panels in Talladega County over the prior ten years only had a small percentage of Black men. The case went to the US Supreme Court, which concluded that the overall percentage disparity was small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the tools we have learned so far, we can use hypothesis testing to determine whether Robert Swain was right. The null hypothesis would be that the jury panel selection was fair; i.e., that any disparities were due to chance alone. Since there were 26% eligible Black men in the Talladega County population, we can assume that the probability of selecting a Black man for the jury panel is $q = 0.26.$ The test statistic we can use here is the number of selected Black (potential) jurors, which in Robert Swain's case is $S = 8.$ The null distribution is binomial with parameters $n = 100$ and $q = 0.26$ (why?). Since we are trying to understand whether the jury panel selection was unfair against  Black people, more extreme cases than having 8 Black potential jurors is having $0, 1, 2, \\dots, 7$ potential jurors. Under the null distribution, the probability of having up to 8 jurors (this is our one-sided p-value) is $p \\approx 4.7 \\cdot 10^{-6}$ (the calculation is provided in the cell below). This is a very low p-value, and it is much lower than even the \"highly statistically significant\" $\\alpha$ of 0.01. Thus, whether we had selected $\\alpha = 0.05$ or $\\alpha = 0.01$ as our significance level, we would have rejected the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative (that the jury panel selection was unfair). \n",

Long after he died, Mendel was accused of manipulating his data.\n",

In this hypothesis test, we would take the null distribution to be that Mendel did not manipulate the data; i.e., that 7 out 8 measurements falling within one standard deviation of the mean is purely due to chance. The alternative we take is again one sided: that Mendel manipulated the data to fall close to the mean. (You could also take the two-sided alternative; this is done in the referenced notes and it does not change the conclusion.) Our test statistic is the number of measurements within one standard deviation from the mean. The significance level we set is $\\alpha = 0.05$. \n",

    "Depending on what we know about the data and how many data samples we have, some concentration inequalities will be more useful than others. Let us reason about that for a bit. Suppose that the test statistic $S$ we use is the mean of the observed data points. Now let us look first at setting where the data is non-negative and we know the mean $\\mu$. With this information alone, we could apply Markov Inequality, which tells us that $\\mathbb{P}[S \\geq t \\mu] \\leq \\frac{1}{t}.$ To reject the null at significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$ using p-values, we would need to use a one-sided test and $t$ would need to be at least 20. So the test statistic would need to be at least 20 times higher than the mean. So Markov Inequality would be useful only if we were seeing really extreme data.\n",

    "Now let us assume that the data is not necessarily non-negative, but in addition to the mean, we also know standard deviation $\\sigma$ (or its square, the variance $\\sigma^2$).

    "\n",
    "In place of computing the exact probability for the z-test, we could also apply Chernoff bounds. For a Gaussian random variable $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1),$ we saw in Lecture 2 that $\\mathbb{P}[Z \\geq t] \\leq e^{-t^2/2}.$ If we had estimated the p-value using this Chernoff bound in the IQ example (the second example from this lecture), we would have gotten $p = \\mathbb{P}[Z \\geq 2.4] = \\leq e^{-2.4^2/2} \\approx 0.056.$ This would not have been sufficient to reject the null (although it is close). However, if we had a little bit more data (say $n = 25$) and the same mean $x = 112,$ then this would have been sufficient to reject the null at significance level $\\alpha = 0.05.$ As a rule of thumb, for z-tests, to reject the null in a one-sided test at significance level $\\alpha = 0.05,$ it suffices that $e^{-t^2/2} \\leq 0.05$, which gives $t \\gtrapprox 2.45.$ This means that, in a one-sided test, the z-statistic is either greater than or equal to $2.45$ or less than or equal to $-2.45$ (depending on whether you are looking at the left or the right tail). You can compute the value of $t$ that is sufficient for two-sided tests as an exercise.\n",

    "Finally, when the data comes from a bounded interval $[a, b]$, we can use Hoeffding bound to bound above the p-value (provided that the statistic we use is the mean).

As with other concentration inequalities, this bound is primarily useful when we have a lot of data. Let us look at an example of jury panels. You used simulations with Eric during the discussion session on 2/25 for a similar example (taken from Section 11.2 of \"Computational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data Science\" by Ani Adhikari, John DeNero, and David Wagner). While simulations are generally useful when we do not know much about the distribution of the statistic and we want to get a rough idea of what is going on, they do not give us a mathematical proof. \n",

Because we do not know a priori what to expect for the mean of the total variation distance, we could adopt a \"signed\" version of the total variation distance, where we assign + when one fixed ethnicity (say, Hispanic) is overrepresented compared to the reference, and - when underrepresented. We now take our test statistic $S$ to be the mean of these signed total variation distances. Our null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the distributions of the local population and the jury panels. The alternative is that there is difference. Under the null hypothesis, the mean of our test statistic is zero, the value of the test statistic is bounded between -1 and 1, and so are all the signed total variation distances that we used to compute the test statistic (why?). Thus, Hoeffding bound applies. Choose the significance level to be $\\alpha = 0.05$.

This means that, assuming that the null hypothesis holds (\"nothing interesting is going on\"), there is a probability of $\\alpha$ that we reject the null and accept the alternative (we conclude that \"there is something interesting going on\"). To make this discussion more concrete, suppose that we set $\\alpha = 0.05.$ Then there is a 1 in 20 probability of a false positive. If there were 20 different teams performing the same hypothesis test, on average, one of them would reject the null at significance level $\\alpha.$ Unfortunately, in scientific research, we are biased towards positive (\"interesting!\") results, so there is a high chance that the team who rejected the null gets to publish a paper. Sometimes the process that leads to the publishing of wrong research results is much more insidious, where multiple hypotheses are run on the same data until the null is rejected. This is called p-hacking. For example, one could test a single drug against many different diseases and conclude that the drug is effective even though it is not, as getting a false positive has a 1 in 20 chance. \n",

Similarly, let us denote by $D = 0$ the decision not to reject the null and by $D = 1$ the decision to reject the null hypothesis. Then $\\mathrm{FDP} \\approx \\mathbb{P}[H = 0| D = 1].$ We mentioned before that this is more of a Bayesian quantity, as it requires knowing the probabilities of $H = 0$ and $H = 1.$ By Bayes theorem, \n",

Suppose that we reject all null hypotheses based on p-values up to some fixed threshold, and suppose that this threshold is exactly equal to the $K^{\\mathrm{th}}$ largest p-value, $p_{\\pi(k)}.$ Based on this construction, $\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}[D = 1] = K/N.$ On the other hand, the probability of a false positive, $\\mathbb{P}[D = 1| H = 0]$, is equal to $p_{\\pi(K)}$. Plugging these observations about $\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}[D = 1]$ and $\\mathbb{P}[D = 1| H = 0]$ into $\\frac{\\mathbb{P}[D = 1| H = 0]}{\\hat{\\mathbb{P}}[D = 1]} \\leq \\bar{\\alpha}$, we get that $\\frac{p_{\\pi(K)}}{K/N} \\leq \\bar{\\alpha}$, or, equivalently, $p_{\\pi(K)} \\leq \\frac{K}{N}\\bar{\\alpha}.$ To have a least conservative rule, we would pick the largest $K$ that satisfes this inequality for a fixed $\\bar{\\alpha}.$ This is precisely what the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure does.

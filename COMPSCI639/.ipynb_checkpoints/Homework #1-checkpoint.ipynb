    "There was a paper published in 2012 that reported the following about height distribution in Netherlands: \"The analysis sample included 5,811 boys and 6,194 girls. [...] Mean final height was 183.8 cm (SD = 7.1 cm) in boys and 170.7 cm (SD = 6.3 cm) in girls.\" (Here, SD stands for standard deviation, but you can ignore it.) Using Markov  inequality, estimate (at most) how many boys and girls from this data set could be taller than 190cm (6ft 2.8in). Would your estimates improve if you were told that the height of the shortest girl in the data set was 145cm, while the height of the shortest boy in the data set was 155cm? If so, provide the improved estimates. "
